# Engineering Workflow Configuration (.dotfiles)

A personal dotfiles repository used to explore tooling, aesthetics, and interaction models, with some components being production-useful and others intentionally experimental.

1. Watch someone on YouTube with a perfect tiling WM
2. Discover lsd, bat, fastfetch, some cursed terminal file manager
3. Install everything
4. Feel powerful
5. Six weeks later: “Why is any of this here”
6. ...?
7. Profit off the actually good tools that stuck around

## Design Goals

- **Reproducibility:** Minimize configuration drift across systems and reinstalls.
- **Low-Friction Onboarding:** Bootstrap a usable environment with minimal manual steps.
- **Systems Thinking:** Treat the development environment as an engineered system.
- **Security by Default:** Hardened shell behavior and conservative environment defaults.
- **Comfortable Aesthetics:** Adjusted to suit my migraine-related visual issues and allow long term focus commitment.
- **Systemic Flexibility:** Able to bring my tastes and tools with me into other environments (Eg. VSCode on Windows)

## What This Repository Demonstrates

- Practical system administration and environment design
- Shell scripting and automation
- Toolchain integration for embedded, systems, and software work
- Opinionated but documented configuration decisions
- Distillation of long-term workflow improvements from short-term experimentation
